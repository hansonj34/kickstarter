# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
I would first like to say, “Thank you” for doing business with our company! Creating a fundraising event is always stressful and a lot of work. The allotment of the $100,000 can be overwhelming. We have viewed other successful campaigns, assessed the instrumental pieces of their progress, and combined your great ideas with ours to bring you a statistically supported plan moving forward.

### Purpose
The purpose of the report is designed to differentiate between your campaign and others regarding launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
We first focused on the money raised by various campaigns. Since Louise estimates that her play will cost $12,000, we researched projects with a similar monetary goal. After organizing the data, many of the campaigns missed their projected goal amounts by a small margin. In finding the percentage of a campaign's funding, we had to determine how close a campaign came to reaching and exceeding their funding goals. Kickstarter allows project creators to add incentives for different pledge amounts, so we determined how much money people pledged to campaigns historically. In discovery, we found the average pledge was $4.02 per person.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
As we can see from the data, May is a great time of year for a theater campaign. Between January and May, the success doubles but quickly tapers down from May on with a small spike upward in October. The failed campaigns closely mirror the successful campaigns but at a much lower percentage.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis tells us that on the extreme levels, less than 1000 and Greater than 50,000, the successful and the failed campaigns were on opposite sides of the spectrum. Less than 1000, 80% of the campaigns were successful and 20% failed. Campaigns greater than 50,000; 80% of the campaigns failed and 20% succeeded.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One challenge was trying not to look at the other options available such as a different play or a different subcategory. It would have been beneficial to offer the client other ways of carrying out the campaign. Included in my report, a suggestion of incorporating a component of music into the campaign was recommended.

The hardest technical challenge was creating the “Outcome based on Goal’s” sheet. The complexity of the formulas was increasing. I made many adjustments and corrected formulas thus persevering through the project.

## CResults
What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? Two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date - Outcomes reached a peak in the Month of May and then decreased from there with a slight rise in October. My suggestions would be to run the campaign in May. After May, the successful percentage decreases dramatically so your duration should be short, a month or two at most.

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? The lower amount was much more achievable. As the amount increased the failure rate increased, and the success rate decreased. Making the goals reasonable (lower) appeared to provide a higher success rate. It may also help morale if participants come away with success. They are more likely to participate the next time the campaign is launched.

What are some limitations of this dataset? Looking at other countries and categories. I would have liked to conduct further analysis of these variables.

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?I have added them above in my analysis.
